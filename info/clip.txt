Line clipping is where the line is examined to see if the line is within the clipping window or not. The parts of the line that are on the outside of the clipping window will be clipped. There are different ways to clip the line. The most time-consuming way to clip the line is to brute force it. This means for the lines that have only one endpoint outside the clipping window, the line and the clipping window’s intersection point is calculated and the line is clipped from that point. If the line has both endpoints inside the clipping window, the line will not be clipped. If the line has both endpoints outside the clipping window, the line will be tested with all of the window’s boundaries to determine if the line intersects. Depending on what parts of the line are outside the clipping window, the line is clipped appropriately. The more efficient way is to use the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm. The Cohen-Sutherland algorithm is based on regions and is most useful for lines with both endpoints either within or outside the clipping window. The algorithm works by dividing the clipping window into regions that are documented by having a unique four bit region code called outcode. When an endpoint is known, the boundaries are determined by the first 1 encountered. In order to find the 1, the regions are moved through from top to bottom to right to left. Eventually, each point is labelled with the corresponding outcode. After determining the labels, the outcodes are evaluated and the lines are cut appropriately.
