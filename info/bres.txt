The Bresenham Line Algorithm
The Bresenham Line algorithm is an efficient technique used for rasterizing lines in computer
graphics, particularly advantageous for its use of only integer arithmetic. It is an improvement
over the DDA algorithm because it eliminates the use of floating-point arithmetic, enhancing
performance.
Key Characteristics of the Bresenham Line Algorithm:
• It determines the closest pixel to the theoretical line to plot on an integer-based grid.
• The big advantage of this algorithm is that it uses only integer calculations for all
operations, ensuring high performance.
• It calculates the error or the difference between the theoretical line and the plotted line,
adjusting it at each step.
The Implementation
This code will open a window where a line is drawn from point (10, 10) to (100, 100) using the
Bresenham algorithm. The drawLine method computes and draws the line based on integer
arithmetic, efficiently deciding the next pixel to plot based on the error term adjustments
throughout the line drawing process.
