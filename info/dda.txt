The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm
The DDA algorithm is used for rasterizing lines in computer graphics. It is a simple and efficient
method to generate a line between two points in a coordinate system. The algorithm works by
calculating intermediate values between endpoints and using these values to plot the line's pixels.
Key Characteristics of the DDA Algorithm:
• It increments one coordinate at a time based on the slope of the line.
• The line's slope determines whether the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate is incremented
by exactly one unit (either pixel-by-pixel along the x-axis or y-axis).
• The other coordinate is incremented by the value of the slope.
• The algorithm uses floating point or integer arithmetic to calculate pixel positions.
The Implementation
This implementation creates a simple window where a line is drawn using the DDA algorithm
from a starting point (10, 10) to an ending point (100, 100). The method drawLine handles the
DDA algorithm's computation and rendering of the line pixel by pixel.
